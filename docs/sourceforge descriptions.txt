Project Short Name:

FreeFrame

Full Name:

FreeFrame Open Video Plugin System

============================================================

Short Description:

FreeFrame is an open video plugin system. In the first instance it is intended mainly for VJ ('Visual Jockey') applications to share realtime video effects plugins. Later we hope to widen the system to include other media and plugin types.

Project Purpose and Summarization (Long Description):

FreeFrame aims to offer an open standard for realtime video plugins.

In the first instance we are mainly aiming to harmonise the realtime video effects plugins used in VJ ('Visual Jockey') applications, so that we can share plugins in a standard format accross applications developed on different compilers and platforms.

We already have a number of open source developers involved who are set to provide a large number of open source plugins for the format (including sourceforge hosted 'EffecTV'). We hope to encourage a large body of open source plugins.

We are currently writing sample code for a host application and simple plugins to demonstrate the use of the API. We hope to make these projects available in Delphi and MSVC on windows and GCC on linux. In the future we hope also to include the mac - we are commited to ensuring cross platform compatability for the format in every way we can.

We have decided to set up FreeFrame becase after extensive research we have not been able to find a video effects plugin system that satisfies the following criteria:

Open - ie. not governed by a commercial organisation. We want to bring together a large number of media applications here, so independence of the format is important for developers to be confident in putting in the work needed to support the format. Openness should also encourage plugin developers in their involvement. We have been very happy with the enthusiasm 

CrossPlatform & CrossCompiler - Many formats use object interfaces and other compiler / platform specific interfaces which prevent those formats from reaching the widest audience, and thus stifle collaboration between developers.

Standardised - The plugin interface we are proposing features heavily standardised interface structures designed to facilitate the implementation of the standard in the wides possible variety of applications. eg. standard ieee 32bit floats running from 0-1 for the plugins paramaters. We plan to keep these principle open for discussion in the initial stages of development, especially when input from people experienced in the field of plugin architecture design is received, but once decided upon we are looking for a very solid and well defined system for version 1.0

Technical independence from the host app - Many of the plugin formats we looked at were only really designed for use with their native host app. FreeFrame intends to address the many considerations of technical independence of the plugin .dll/.so from the host app that are required for a robust format suitable for a wide range of existing host applications.

The first version of FreeFrame will only be for the processing of frames of video, but if all goes well with FreeFrame v1 we hope to widen the project into neighbouring fields - possibly including  audio, MIDI, OpenGL, 'synthesizer' style plugins (both for video and audio) and possibly even 'instrument' style plugins. We will be keen to investigate these areas much more fully before commiting to further developments - for the moment we are focused on video effects / visual synthesiser.

Project Initiators:

Russell Blakeborough - VJamm - www.vjamm.com - www.vjammpro.com - Camart - www.camart.co.uk
Marcus Clements - Brightonart - www.brightonart.org - VST plugin developer
Edwin de Koning - Resolume - www.resolume.com - VJ software programmer and plugin developer
Bartholomew van der Ploeg - Resolume

Additional Core Group at this stage:

AP (Aparimana/Julian Hone) - Camart
Pete Warden - Cush Games - experienced plugin developer
Buddy Smith - EffecTV - plugin developer

VJamm and Resolume are the 2 VJ applications which have commited to implementing the format in the first instance, but we are keen to open up the format to general participation as soon as it is stabalised. It looks already like EffecTV (linux) might be able to support the FreeFrame standard. EffecTV and Pete Warden have transferred their plugins to the LGPL to allow us to port them to FreeFrame.
