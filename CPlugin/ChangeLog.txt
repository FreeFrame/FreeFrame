	* ChangeLog.txt: Created
	* FreeFrameSample.cpp:
		Added a better capability check in initialize
		Changed processFrame to dispatch to a templated function, so that 24 and 32 bits implementations share the same source.
		Added a few bugfixes and optimalisations.
	* FreeFrameSample.h:
		Changed VideoPixel32bitTag struct so that alpha comes last, this resolved some problems i had when testing the plugin, i hope is not a cludge.
