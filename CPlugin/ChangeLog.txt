2003/03/29	Bart van der Werf (Bluelive) <bluelive@xs4all.nl>
	* ChangeLog.txt: Created
	* FreeFrameSample.cpp:
		Added a better capability check in initialize
		Changed processFrame to dispatch to a templated function, so that 24 and 32 bits implementations share the same source.
		Added a few bugfixes and optimalisations.
	* FreeFrameSample.h:
		Changed VideoPixel32bitTag struct so that alpha comes last, this resolved some problems i had when testing the plugin, i hope is not a cludge.
	* MemCopy.h MemCopy.cpp:
		Provides the function memcopy, which is the same as memcpy, except it checks what type of processor is available and uses a better suited assembly routine, currently either mmx, 3dnowext or the old memcpy
		On linux or when NO_INTEL is used, the standard memcpy will be used through a macro removing anyoverhead.
		The assembly should be usable under linux, but it will first be needed to converted to at&t syntax.
		Support should be added to take the best advantage of sse/sse2/simd/3dnow,
